# degrad

Angular unit conversion between degrees, radians, and gradians.

## Usage

### Install

```shell
    npm install degrad --save // -> Installs it via NPM
    yarn add degrad // -> Installs it via Yarn
```

### Build

`degrad` is built using Gulp, a task automation service. When building `degrad`,
you can either invoke Gulp directly via the `gulp` command, or allow NPM to take
care of invoking Gulp by executing `npm run build`. Both commands do exactly the
same task internally.

```shell
    npm run build // -> Build via NPM script
    gulp // -> Build via Gulp script
```

### Functions

`degrad` exposes a small library of functions for accurately converting between
angular units, specifically degrees, radians, and gradians.
